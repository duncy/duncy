My custom DWM config.h  
Uses the [fullgaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fullgaps/) and [anybar-polybar-tray-fix](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/anybar/) patches.  
Note that the anybar patch is for polybar integration so also include [polybar-dwm-module](https://github.com/mihirlad55/polybar-dwm-module) and it's requirements.   
Version 6.2
