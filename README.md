My name is Duncan. I'm sure if given the chance, I'd think it was very nice to meet you.

I'm an overambitious programmer and easily distracted by new projects.
I tend to burn myself out a lot and when I am programming, I tend to forget to use source control. So let me know if you want me to update anything!
 
I have a [website](https://duncy.nz/). (I think)
