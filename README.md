My name is Duncan.  
I'm currently studying for a Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Computer Science at the University of Canterbury.

I'm an overambitious programmer and easily distracted by new projects.
I tend to not use source control when working on my own projects. 

I also have a [website](https://duncy.nz/). (I think)
