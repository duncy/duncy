Hi! My name is Duncan.  

I am in the middle of migrating from a Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Computer Science to a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering, hopefully with a minor in Communication Engineering. 

I'm currently studying all this at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. :)

I'm an overambitious programmer and am easily distracted by new projects.

I have a [website](https://duncy.nz/).
